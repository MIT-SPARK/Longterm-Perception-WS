We invite short papers of novel or recently published research relevant to the topics of the workshop.
* Short papers are 2+n pages (2 pages content + references)
* Submissions must follow the [IEEE Conference double column format](https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html)
* All accepted papers will be presented as posters at the workshop and published on the workshop website.
* Please indicate whether your paper falls into the <strong>‘novel’</strong> or <strong>‘previously published’</strong> category. Novel research papers are encouraged and can expect more substantial review feedback on their work. This is provided as a service to authors of novel papers and does not diminish the chance of acceptance.
* All accepted submissions will be considered for the best presentation award, where 3 finalists will be selected for 5-minute plenary presentations. While all submissions are eligible, novelty will be considered in finalist selection.
* Submissions are single blind and will be reviewed by members of the (extended) workshop committee.
* Submissions can optionally be accompanied by a video.

### <strong>Invited topics</strong>
We invite contributions from the areas of:
* Scene and object representations
* Long-term mapping and scene understanding
* Open-set scene understanding and foundation models
* Motion and change detection
* Prediction and planning in dynamic and changing scenes
* Safety in perception, planning and prediction
* Continual and lifelong learning

### <strong>Review Criteria</strong>

Novel submission will be evaluated on:
* Relevance to the topics of the workshop
* Recency and novelty
* Clarity of presentation
* Technical Quality
* Strength of results (i.e., the results show promise for early stage work, the (planned) experimental setup is adequate)

Papers that have previously been published will mainly be evaluated on the first two points (relevance and recency). If so, please mention in the submission where it has been published.
