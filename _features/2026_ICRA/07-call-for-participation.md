    - <strong>Review Criteria</strong>: As a service to authors, ideas submissions will receive thorough review and detailed feedback from the committee.Evaluation criteria are Relevance to the topics of the workshop, Recency and novelty, Clarity of presentation, Technical Quality, and  Strength of results (i.e., the results show promise for early stage work, the (planned) experimental setup is adequate)
- <strong><span style="font-size:1.2em;">Showcase Track</span></strong>
    - <strong>Aim</strong>: This track is open to work previously published that are relevant to the discussion at the workshop, and aims to foster author discussion and enrich the diversity of content at the workshop. Recent ICRA’26 papers are eligible and encouraged.

    - <strong>Format</strong>: A video highlighting the potential demonstration. For web or algorithm demos, this can also be a screen capture.

### <strong>Submissions Timeline</strong>
We provide two submission cycles: i) an early bird submission allows authors who depend on the workshop to make travel arrangements to get this information early, ii) the regular timeline allows authors who need more time to finish their contributions to do so.
