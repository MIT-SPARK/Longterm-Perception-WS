<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
Autonomy in highly dynamic human-centric real-world environments is a crucial challenge at the forefront of robotics. This has recently sparked notable progress and interest in short-term dynamic and 4D scene understanding, where, in contrast, long-term dynamics of human-centric scenes are emerging as a prominent robotics frontier with a more splintered community.

<span style="font-size:1.1em;">
After the large successes of the first Long-Term Perception (LTP): <a href='{{ site.baseurl }}/2024_IROS/'>“What do Robots Need?”</a> and <a href='https://montrealrobotics.ca/test-of-time-workshop/'>“Standing the Test of Time”</a> workshops at IROS’24, we are joining forces to bring together researchers across communities from Robotics, Computer Vision (CV), and Machine Learning (ML) on the LTP problem. The goal of the workshop is to i) illustrate the different facets, applications, interpretations, and most recent advances in LTP, ii) bring to together a community to unify terms, ideas, and spark new connections, iii) discuss emerging techniques, core challenges, and set the direction of research to address them in the coming years.

This iteration of the workshop emphasizes interaction with leaders and rising stars in LTP and especially invites junior and new-to-the-topic researchers to become part of the community, featuring a tutorial, a mentoring event, interactive discussion and poster sessions, as well as multiple submission tracks (Ideas/Showcase/Demo) to participate.
